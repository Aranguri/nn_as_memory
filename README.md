# nn_as_memory
This is a project where I experimented with memory-augmented neural networks. I implemented a neural network that uses [another neural network](https://github.com/Aranguri/nn_as_memory/blob/nn_as_ext_memory/memory_cell_nn.py) to store long-term memories. I also implemented a standard memory-augmented NN, that is, a NN that writes/reads from a [matrix](https://github.com/Aranguri/nn_as_memory/blob/nn_as_ext_memory/memory_cell_matrix.py). I trained this two models in storing and recovering emnist characters. While there are no meaningful measures of how good it did, the characters were recovered clearly. Even when trained in several different representations of the same character, the model learned to represent the character in a way that a human would clearly understand what character the NN is referring to. (This isn't trivial: the average of a thousand images of a 6 could be a very blurred image with no clear number on it.)
